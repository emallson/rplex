# RPLEX

Rust bindings for
[CPLEX](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/),
an IP/MIP/QP solver from IBM. Currently highly experimental but
working for IP/MIP problems.

```toml
[dependencies]
rplex = {version = "0.2", git = "https://github.com/emallson/rplex.git"} 
```

You *must* have CPLEX installed for RPLEX to work. The build script
attempts to locate CPLEX automatically (and should do so assuming
you've installed it at the usual location on Linux). CPLEX is not
necessary to run a binary compiled with RPLEX; static linking is used.

## !!Warning!!

There is an issue with the `var!` macro which has not been resolved where it cannot distinguish between `var!(lb <= name)` and `var!(name <= ub)` shorthands (see  https://github.com/emallson/rplex/issues/3). These will eventually be removed, but I no longer have a copy of CPLEX available to use in supporting RPLEX.

# Example

```rust
fn lpex1() {
    // create a CPLEX environment
    let env = Env::new().unwrap();
    // populate it with a problem
    let mut prob = Problem::new(&env, "lpex1").unwrap();
    // maximize the objective
    prob.set_objective_type(ObjectiveType::Maximize).unwrap();
    // create our variables
    let x1 = prob.add_variable(var!(0.0 <= "x1" <= 40.0 -> 1.0)).unwrap();
    let x2 = prob.add_variable(var!("x2" -> 2.0)).unwrap();
    let x3 = prob.add_variable(var!("x3" -> 3.0)).unwrap();
    println!("{} {} {}", x1, x2, x3);

    // add our constraints
    prob.add_constraint(con!("c1": 20.0 >= (-1.0) x1 + 1.0 x2 + 1.0 x3)).unwrap();
    prob.add_constraint(con!("c2": 30.0 >= 1.0 x1 + (-3.0) x2 + 1.0 x3)).unwrap();

    // solve the problem
    let sol = prob.solve().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", sol);
    // values taken from the output of `lpex1.c`
    assert!(sol.objective == 202.5);
    assert!(sol.variables == vec![VariableValue::Continuous(40.0),
                                    VariableValue::Continuous(17.5),
                                    VariableValue::Continuous(42.5)]);
}
```
